The fishermen mended their nets and repaired their sails here. Plus, it was a lively meeting place for inhabitants and traders.It is here where they exchanged ideas or strolled around during an organ recital. In the Middle Ages Amsterdam became an important mercantile town. In 1345 the eucharistic Miracle of Amsterdam occurred. Surely, the town transformed into a popular place of pilgrimage for the faithful.Around 1400 it counted more than 3,000 inhabitants. With all these series of events happening at the church, it acquired the nickname: ‘Huiskamer van Amsterdam’ (‘Amsterdam’s Living Room’).",
