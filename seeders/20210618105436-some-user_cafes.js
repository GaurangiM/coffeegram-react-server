We took a table in the terrace, which was on the river and it was heavenly! I had cappuccino and it was the best I had in Amsterdam. If you enjoy having a good cup of coffee or late morning breakfast on the river, I would highly recommend this place.',

The food was incredible and tasted amazing! Presentation speaks for itself in the photos.But the star of the show had to be their coconuts from Bali, I personally have never been to Bali it's on my list of places to go but the fact you can experience a little part of it in Amsterdam makes this place extra special. It was fresh, and the taste was like nothing I've ever had before. I would go back to Amsterdam just for one of those coconuts.",

There was no place for us once we came in and they told us to wait. After 15m or so we were kindly escorted to a nice and accomodating table. They really know what they are serving. The lady who took us gave us very good advice in what to have according to our personal taste. This is what we had. Enormous portions and tasted divine! Price was very reasonable. This will be definetly one of our top options if we ever come back to this amazing city! Thank you so much!',

Prices are agreeable (EUR2 for an espresso / EUR3,40 for a flat white) and their homemade sweets are a pure delight. The place is decorated in a semi-modern boho chic style. It‚Äôs small but it‚Äôs cozy and that has a sort of charm to it. There‚Äôs a cat too, standing by the door kingly, greeting you as you come in. Only coffee lovers allowed.",

Why i didnt five 5 stars is because sometimes the service isnt as good, and it takes a long time to wait or your food is cold.",
