We took a table in the terrace, which was on the river and it was heavenly! I had cappuccino and it was the best I had in Amsterdam. If you enjoy having a good cup of coffee or late morning breakfast on the river, I would highly recommend this place.',

The food was incredible and tasted amazing! Presentation speaks for itself in the photos.But the star of the show had to be their coconuts from Bali, I personally have never been to Bali it's on my list of places to go but the fact you can experience a little part of it in Amsterdam makes this place extra special. It was fresh, and the taste was like nothing I've ever had before. I would go back to Amsterdam just for one of those coconuts.",

There was no place for us once we came in and they told us to wait. After 15m or so we were kindly escorted to a nice and accomodating table. They really know what they are serving. The lady who took us gave us very good advice in what to have according to our personal taste. This is what we had. Enormous portions and tasted divine! Price was very reasonable. This will be definetly one of our top options if we ever come back to this amazing city! Thank you so much!',

        review: "Favorite cafe in The Hague! Best quality espresso/coffee, and nice that you get to choose which bean you want and learn about the sourcing. The croissants are all delicious, so inventive flavor-wise and always baked perfectly, and I highly recommend going for a bigger brunch as well. Pretty sure I‚Äôve tried everything on the menu by now and I‚Äôd easily order everything again. The staff are also super friendly and helpful. Can‚Äôt say enough good things!",

The phrase 'single origin' on the window made me think this couldn't be a dime a dozen. So I went there to taste an espresso. I was not disappointed, it was a delicious coffee with a very distinct taste, rich in flavor ingredients. I come here a few times a week now",
